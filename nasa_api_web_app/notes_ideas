could implemenet day / night mode (white vs black background)

make it pretty... maybe a dropdown menu for date picker so it takes up less screen space. make the photo or video the main attraction, and center the text 

make it accessible, ie larger text accomodations

make it responsive, viewable on mobile

make photos limited in size? no scroll page? header and footer? with my socials?
